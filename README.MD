## Overview

Accurate occupancy detection is crucial for optimizing building energy management. Challenges arising from limited data, sensor noise, and intricate dynamics often undermine precision. In this project, we propose a two-step approach to address these challenges:

1. **Feature Enhancement**: We incorporate supplementary features derived from building information to enhance data quality and predictive capacity.

2. **Physics-Based Regularization**: A physics-based regularizer is integrated into a Bayesian Neural Network Model, ensuring adherence to constraints and reliable uncertainty estimation, thus elevating prediction precision.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The replication package requires Python 3.8+ and a bunch of dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install the `requirements.txt` before running each notebook.

```
pip install -r requirements.pip
```
